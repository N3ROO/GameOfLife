# Le jeu de la vie
![Version 0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0-red.svg)

The game of life consists in 4 rules :

    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
    
                                                                                 Extracted from Wikipedia
